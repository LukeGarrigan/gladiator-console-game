# Gladiator Console Game

Just a text-based game to play around with some C# in an attempt to understand the language.

## Some C# feature fluff I've used:
- LINQ queries
- Anonymous Methods and Lambda Expressions
- Delegates
- Tasks and multithreading
- Implicit Typing
- Optional parameters
- Enums

## Some C# feature fluff I'd like to add:
- Async & await
- Attributes
- Events
- Anonymous Types 
- Reflection 

## Some C# features I'm aware of but probably won't add:
- Extension methods
- The dynamic keyword
